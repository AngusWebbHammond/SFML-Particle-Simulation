# Particle Simulation

This is a particle simulation programmed in C++, influenced off of Keyframe Codes on youtube for the main boilerplate code to get the main simulation working.

My aim with this project is to create a particle simulation I can add forces to, to allow N-Body simulations to take place, such as gravity.

## Future Features

* Optimisation
* Other solid bodies
* Drag and Drop of particles
* Sizeable window creating more space for the solver
* Other Forces
* Water Simulations
